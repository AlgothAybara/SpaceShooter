# Overview

Creating a top-down 2D space adventure/rpg. In it, you are a pilot of a spaceship trying to make your mark in the great unknowns of space. 

I grew up playing similar games and have always wanted to make my own. This is the start of my venture into the great unknowns of game development.

So far the game is pretty simple to play thus far using wsad or the arrow keys to move and the spacebar to shoot.
